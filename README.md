# Module 1 Challenge - Code Refactor

## Description

I was given an existing codebase which contained a bug with one of the navbar links, a non-descriptive title, non-semantic elements, accessibility issues, and CSS code that was repeated across similar elements.  I was tasked with refactoring the code in order to address these issues.

Acceptance Criteria is listed below and all bugs and issues have been resolved.  Comments have been added where changes have been made in both the HTML and CSS files.

## Acceptance Criteria -

GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
